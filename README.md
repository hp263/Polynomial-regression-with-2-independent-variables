# Polynomial-regression-with-2-independent-
% This function is for polynomial multivariable regression with 2
% independent variables, using a known degree (order). the input of x_tran
% is a n*2 matrix which contains x1 and x2,and y_tran is a n*1 matrix
% which contains the true output value. Degree is the order of polynomial
% fit model. The output y_predict is our regression result using our model.
% error is the model predict error using LSE method.
